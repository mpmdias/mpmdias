<h2 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Pubudu</h2>

<h4 align="center">A passionate Devops engineer</h4>

I have worked in IT for over three years as a DevOps Engineer. I enjoy finding innovative uses for technology and am always looking for better approaches to enhancing the speed and security of software creation and distribution.

Python, Terraform, Docker, and Amazon Web Services are just a few of the DevOps tools and technologies that I am well-versed in. In addition, I have extensive knowledge of networking and security and am proficient as a system administrator.

I like to take trips, hang out with my loved ones, and watch films when I have free time. I also regularly contribute to several open-source projects and am an outspoken supporter of free and open-source software.

I have extensive experience as a DevOps Engineer and am very driven and knowledgeable in this field. I bring a lot to the table and am always up for a challenge.
